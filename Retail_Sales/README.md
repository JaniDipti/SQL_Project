Project Title: Retail Sales Analysis

Database:sql_project_p2

This project is designed to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. The project involves setting up a retail sales database, Performing Exploratory Data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions through SQL queries.To complement the SQL analysis, an interactive Tableau dashboard was created to visualize key insights from the retail sales data.

This unguided project demonstrates my ability to clean, manipulate, and analyze data using SQL, and to present key business insights through interactive dashboards in Tableau. It simulates the kind of data analysis a retail business would use to understand performance, optimize sales, and improve customer targeting.

Objectives

Set up a retail sales database: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.
Data Cleaning: 
Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
Business Analysis: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.

Project Structure
Database SetupDatabase Creation: The project starts by creating a database named sql_project_p2.
Table Creation: 
A table named retail_sales_data is created to store the sales data. The table structure includes columns for transaction ID, sale date, sale time, customer ID, gender, age, product category, quantity sold, price per unit, cost of goods sold (COGS), and total sale amount.

CREATE TABLE retail_sales_data
            (
                transaction_id INT PRIMARY KEY,	
                sale_date DATE,	 
                sale_time TIME,	
                customer_id	INT,
                gender	VARCHAR(15),
                age	INT,
                category VARCHAR(15),

                total_sale FLOAT
            );
Data Exploration & Cleaning

Record Count: Determine the total number of records in the dataset.
Customer Count: Find out how many unique customers are in the dataset.
Category Count: Identify all unique product categories in the dataset.
Null Value Check: Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.

-- Data Analysis & Business Key Problems & Answers

 To retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05

SELECT *
FROM retail_sales_data
WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';

To retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of Nov-2022

SELECT * 
FROM retail_sales_data
WHERE category = 'Clothing' 
  AND DATE_FORMAT(sale_date, '%Y-%m') = '2022-11' 
  AND quantity >= 4 
LIMIT 0, 1000;

To calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category.

SELECT 
    category,
    SUM(total_sale) as net_sale,
    COUNT(*) as total_orders
FROM retail_sales_data
GROUP BY 1

The average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.

SELECT
    ROUND(AVG(age), 2) as avg_age
FROM retail_sales_data
WHERE category = 'Beauty';


To find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000.

SELECT * FROM retail_sales_data
WHERE total_sale > 1000


The total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category.

SELECT 
    category,
    gender,
    COUNT(*) as total_trans
FROM retail_sales_data
GROUP 
    BY 
    category,
    gender
ORDER BY 1

To calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year

SELECT
